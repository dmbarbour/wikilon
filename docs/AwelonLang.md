# Awelon Language

Awelon is a purely functional language based on concatenative combinators.

## Why Another Language?

Modern programming languages can produce useful artifacts - applications, games, and so on. But they do not support flexible composition and decomposition of these artifacts. There are a lot of complicating factors: hidden runtime structure, entanglement of effects and environment, separation of programmer and user interfaces, even how software is packaged and shared in a community.

Awelon language aims to be simple and scalable, addressing these complications. It explores a new way of developing and sharing code and computational artifacts. Some design points:

* Awelon evaluates by local confluent rewriting, much like expression `(6 * 7)` evaluates to `42` in arithmetic. Every evaluation step has representation within Awelon language and may thus be serialized or rendered - i.e. it's easy to "show the work". Rewrite based evaluation simplifies debugging, distribution, integration of the program with HCI, and further use of program results.

* Awelon has a simple, Forth-like syntax. This lowers barriers for [projectional editing](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ProjectionalEditing.html). Editable views can support domain-specific notations or allow interactive editing of Awelon via forms or graphs. 

* Awelon specifies 'lazy linking' of words by the evaluator. That is, a word is not rewritten to its definition unless doing so would result in further rewrites. This allows for results to contain human-meaningful references and code fragments. Importantly, editable views can be applied to results, which helps unify programmer and user interfaces.

* Awelon has a simple, pure, deterministic, portable semantics. It is easy to share code with others. Programs are concatenative, which simplifies composition and decomposition of code fragments. Definitions are acyclic, so it's easy to extract only necessary fragments of a dictionary.

* Awelon uses *Acceleration* as the performance alternative to built-in functions or FFI. This enables an interesting path of language growth that doesn't complicate semantics or security. Minimally, runtimes should accelerate natural numbers and arithmetic. But acceleration can potentially leverage GPGPUs (by accelerating linear algebra) or cloud computing (by accelerating Kahn process networks).

Awelon experiments with alternative [application models](ApplicationModel.md). The most promising models are RESTful - documents, publish subscribe, tuple spaces, etc. - integrating application state with the codebase instead of an external filesystem or database. The codebase then becomes a 'smart' filesystem or database, with more deeply integrated linking and computational structure similar to a spreadsheet. The codebase is maintained by a community of human and software agents, exactly as we'd maintain a database or filesystem.

Integration of Awelon systems with external systems will initially rely on web services or publish-subscribe systems. 

## Primitives

There are four primitive combinators:

            [B][A]a == A[B]         (apply)
            [B][A]b == [[B]A]       (bind)
               [A]c == [A][A]       (copy)
               [A]d ==              (drop)

Square brackets `[]` enclose Awelon code and represent first-class functions. This, together with various Church or Moegensen-Scott encodings, is the basis for representing data and computations in Awelon. Awelon computations are semantically pure, and their entire formal behavior can be understood in terms of these few primitives.

However, to achieve performance, we additionally leverage *Acceleration*. This is Awelon's alternative to built-in functions and data-types. or performance-motivated FFI. Acceleration is discussed below. We can also leverage *Annotations*, to improve performance and 

This set of combinators is Turing complete, able to represent all deterministically computable functions. As a lightweight proof, I'll define the Curry-SchoÌˆnfinkel SKI [combinators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic).

            [B][A]w == [A][B]       (swap)           w = [] b a
               [A]i == A            (inline)         i = [] w a d
         [C][B][A]s == [[C]B][C]A   (S combinator)   s = [[c] a b w] a i
            [B][A]k == A            (K combinator)   k = a d

A simple translation from lambda calculus is also provided in discussion of *Named Local Variables* (in context of *Editable Views*). Compared to lambda calculus or SKI combinators, Awelon's semantics are simpler: 

1. Combinator rewriting is much simpler than variable substitution. There is no need for environment management, variable capture or lexical scope. There is no risk of representing free variables. 
1. The stack-like environment enables uniform abstraction for multiple arguments or results without explicit tupling, and provides a foundation for *Static Typing* based on arity without need for atomic value types.
1. The explicit copy and drop operations simplify substructural type analysis, reference counting GC, and potential acceleration using in-place update for uniquely referenced, indexed data structures.

## Encoding

Awelon is encoded using a subset of ASCII, bytes 32..126. 

Newlines and tabs are among the rejected characters. However, humans will frequently manipulate Awelon code through *Editable Views* that may present a more sophisticated surface syntax, potentially including tables or graphical representations. Large texts or binaries cannot be efficiently embedded in Awelon, but may be referenced via *Secure Hash Resources* and constructed via *Stowage*. 

## Words

Words are the user-definable unit for Awelon code. Structurally, a word has regular expression `[a-z][a-z_0-9]*`. That is, it consists of alphanumerics and the underscore, and must start with an alpha. There is also a size limit: words must not surpass 63 characters in length.

Words are evaluated in context of a *Dictionary*. Each word is defined by an Awelon program, using other words. Valid definitions must form a directed acyclic graph and be block balanced (i.e. no unmatched `[` or `]` block characters). The formal semantics for words are extremely trivial: we lazily substitute the word by its definition.

Although structure within a word has no semantic properties, it may have connotations and conventions. For example, we might associate `foo_type` or `foo_doc` with `foo` in context of a linter or development environment. Lightweight namespaces are also feasible.

The four primitive words `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` cannot be redefined. The four words `zero`, `succ`, `null`, and `cons` should be defined to support natural numbers, embedded texts, and binary resources.

*Aside:* A trivial cyclic definition of a word to itself is equivalent to an undefined word, and may be considered the default.

## Natural Numbers

Awelon has native support for natural numbers. Syntactically, numbers are represented by regex `0|[1-9][0-9]*` wherever a word may appear. 

        0 = [zero]
        1 = [0 succ]
        2 = [1 succ]
        3 = [2 succ]
        ...
        42 = [41 succ]
        (et cetera)

Definitions for `zero` and `succ` are left to the dictionary. Wrapping everything in blocks provides a simple structural guarantee that numbers may be treated as values regardless of definition. In practice, natural numbers must be defined based on *Acceleration*. With accelerated arithmetic, for example, we could add two numbers in log-time rather than linear time. Awelon does not support any other number types natively, but *Editable Views* can be leveraged to support numerical towers at the syntactic layer.

## Embedded Texts

Awelon has native support for embedding texts inline between double quotes such as `"Hello, world!"`. Embedded texts are limited to ASCII, specifically the subset valid in Awelon code (32-126) minus the double quote `"` (34). There are no escape characters. Semantically, a text represents a binary list.

        ""      = [null]
        "hello" = [104 "ello" cons]

Definitions for `null` and `cons` are left to the dictionary. Like natural numbers, we have a structural guarantee of value type, and definitions are likely to be determined by available runtime acceleration. In this case, acceleration could support lists via arrays.

Embedded texts are suitable only for simple things like labels, test data, comments, and micro-DSLs such as regular expressions. They are not very suitable for general use. To work around these limitations, the primary options are:

* interpret, e.g. `"multiple\nlines" lit` to rewrite escapes
* structure, e.g. `["multiple" ["lines" [null] cons] cons] unlines`
* use *Secure Hash Resources* to reference external binary

Interpeted text is a convenient hack but doesn't scale, compose, or abstract nicely. Structure is easy to abstract, compose, and evolve to support mixed data, but needs *Editable Views* to provide a usable syntax. Use of *Secure Hash Resources* is the most convenient wherever you'd conventionally use an external text or binary file.

## Secure Hash Resources

It is possible to identify binaries by their *secure hash*. Doing so has many nice properties: immutable and acyclic by construction, cacheable, securable, provider-independent, self-authenticating, implicitly shared, automatically named, uniformly sized, and smaller than many full URLs or file paths. Awelon systems leverage secure hashes to reference binaries and code outside the dictionary:

* external binary data may be referenced via `%secureHash`
* code and structured data is referenced via `$secureHash`

Secure hash resources may appear anywhwere an Awelon word may appear, and are interpreted relative to the local dictionary. For example, binaries use the same encoding as embedded texts, and their semantics ultimately depend on the local definitions for `zero`, `succ`, `null`, and `cons`.

Awelon uses the 320-bit [BLAKE2b](https://blake2.net/) algorithm, encoding the hash with 64 characters in a [base32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32) alphabet specialized to avoid conflicts with numbers or human meaningful words. 

Some example hashes, chained from the word `test`:

        rmqJNQQmpNmKlkRtsbjnjdmbLQdpKqNlndkNKKpnGDLkmtQLPNgBBQTRrJgjdhdl
        cctqFDRNPkprCkMhKbsTDnfqCFTfSHlTfhBMLHmhGkmgJkrBblNTtQhgkQGQbffF
        bKHFQfbHrdkGsLmGhGNqDBdfbPhnjJQjNmjmgHmMntStsNgtmdqmngNnNFllcrNb
        qLDGfKtQHhhTthNTDMMqDMDKnrCTpSSBHHBjDNtsKrTdNRGgtmtqQFTdGjsnfJDR

        Base32 Alphabet: bcdfghjklmnpqrstBCDFGHJKLMNPQRST
            encoding 0..31 respectively

We can safely neglect the theoretical concern of secure hash collisions. Even if hash collision becomes a concern in the future, it is feasible to transitively rewrite entire Awelon systems to use a more robust hash. In practice, physical corruption should be a greater concern. I won't further belabor the issue.

Awelon runtime systems must know where to seek secure hash resources, whether that be in a filesystem, database, web server, or content distribution network. Using *Stowage* annotations, Awelon runtime systems may also compute new secure hash resources during evaluation, treating this external space as a persistent virtual memory or a binary data server.

Secure hash resources are generally subject to [garbage collection (GC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29). Conservative reference counting GC is simple and effective due to the acyclic and high-latency nature of secure hash resources.

*Security Note:* Secure hash resources may embed sensitive information, yet are not subject to conventional access control. Awelon systems should treat a secure hash as an [object capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model) - a bearer token that grants read authority. Relevantly, Awelon systems should resist timing attacks that might leak secure hashes.

## Dictionary

Awelon words are defined in a dictionary. Evaluation of Awelon code occurs in context of an immutable dictionary. Awelon doesn't specify a dictionary representation. I hope for de-facto standards to arise around the import, export, sharing, and backup of dictionaries, and potentially dictionaries as first-class values.

Definitions for words must form a directed acyclic graph. Cyclic behavior must use anonymous recursion via fixpoint combinators, cf. *Fixpoints and Loops* below. Assigning a trivial cycle such as `foo = foo` may be treated as equivalent to deleting word `foo` from the dictionary.

Dictionaries are usually manipulated through services, such as a web application or a [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) filesystem adapter. The use of such layers is also necessary to provide useful *Editable Views*.

See also *Hierarchical Dictionaries*. Dictionaries may contain dictionaries.

## Acceleration

Acceleration is a performance assumption for Awelon. 

A runtime will recognize and accelerate common functions. The accelerated implementation may be hand optimized and built into the runtime to achieve performance similar to a primitive. For example, runtimes might accelerate the following functions:

           [A]i == A            (inline)         i = [] w a d
        [B][A]w == [A][B]       (swap)           w = [] b a

The runtime will look at the given definitions. Upon recognizing `[] b a`, the runtime may link `w` to an acclerated swap implementation. Whenever `i` appears at the end of a subprogram, we might leverage the tail-call optimization.

In general, recognition of accelerators may be fragile. It may be that `i = [] w a d` is recognized where the logically equivalent `i = [[]] a a d` is not recognized. Even changing function names could break accelerators. This is ultimately up to the runtime. Due to this fragility, a runtime should carefully document recognized accelerators, and provide some means to warn developers in case of bad assumptions. A useful convention is to support an `(accel)` annotation that asserts a block of code should be specially recognized and accelerated.

Critically, acceleration of functions extends to data representation. Natural numbers, for example, have a unary structure `42 = [41 succ]`. But under the hood they could (and should!) be compactly represented by machine words, with arithmetic on natural numbers reduced to a machine operation. We can accelerate lists to use array representations and in-place indexed updates for unique references. We can feasibly accelerate linear algebra to leverage a GPGPU, or accelerate Kahn process networks to leverage distributed CPUs and memory.

Accelerators are not trivial. Every accelerator represents a significant investment of time, and a complication for the runtime implementations. Hence, it's best if we seek small subset of accelerators that is both simple and good for a wide variety of use cases.

## Annotations

Annotations help developers control, optimize, view, and debug computations. Unlike words, which are mostly user-defined, annotations are given meaning by the runtime or compiler. Annotations are represented as parenthetical words like `(par)` or `(a3)`. Potential useful annotations:

* `(a2)..(a9)` - arity annotations to defer computations
* `(t1)..(t9)` - tuple assertions for output scope control
* `(unit)` - assert empty block
* `(nc) (nd)` - support substructural type safety
* `(seal_foo) (open_foo)` - lightweight type tag and assertions
* `(par)` - request parallel evaluation of computation
* `(eval)` - request immediate evaluation of computation
* `(nat)` - assert argument should be a natural number
* `(optimize)` - rewrite a function for efficient evaluation
* `(jit)` - compile a function for efficient evaluation
* `(stow)` - move large values to disk, load on demand
* `(memo)` - memoize a computation for incremental computing
* `(trace)` - record value to a debug output log
* `(trash)` - erase data you won't observe, leave placeholder
* `(error)` - mark a value as an error object
* `(accel)` - assert block of code should have runtime acceleration
* `(eq)` - assert structural equality of two values
* `(eq_foo)` - assert equal to def, reduce code to known name (quines)

Annotations must have no observable effect within a computation. However, annotations should have externally observable consequences, e.g. optimize might perform rewrites we can see when viewing the evaluation, trace generates a debug log, jit and par make programs evaluate faster. Stowage and memoization can interact with disk or networks. Further, annotations may cause computations to halt early, as with arity annotations, failed assertions, applied error values, and sealers. 

Annotations are defined by the runtime. In case of porting code, runtimes that do not recognize an annotation may ignore it. In the long run, we should have de-facto standard annotations that are widely supported, while experimental or runtime-specific annotations should be indicated with appropriate prefix.

## Stowage

Stowage is a simple idea, summarized by rewrite rules:

        [large value](stow) => [$secureHash]
        [small value](stow) => [small value]
        [large binary](stow) => %secureHash

Stowage allows secure hash resources to be constructed at runtime and removed from working memory until later required. Essentially, this gives us a functional, persistent virtual memory model. Further, these hashes can be used efficiently together with memoization as a basis for incremental computing for very large systems.

What "large value" means is heuristic, but should be reproducible. If configured, it should be configurable from the dictionary, perhaps by defining `stow_threshold`. It might also be useful to support a few different size thresholds, enabling use of `(stow_small)` vs. `(stow_large)`.

## Evaluation

Evaluation of an Awelon program results in an equivalent Awelon program, one from which it is hopefully easier to extract information or more efficiently perform further evaluations. Awelon's primary evaluation mode proceeds by local rewriting. The four primitives rewrite by simple pattern matching:

            [B][A]a => A[B]         (apply)
            [B][A]b => [[B]A]       (bind)
               [A]c => [A][A]       (copy)
               [A]d =>              (drop)

Words rewrite to their evaluated definitions. However, words do not rewrite unless doing so leads to a result other than a trivial inlining of the word's evaluated definition. This constraint is called lazy linking, and it supports various performance and aesthetic goals. An undefined word represents an unknown and does not evaluate further.

Awelon's basic evaluation strategy is simple:

* rewrite outer program
* evaluate before copy 
* evaluate final values

Evaluating the outer program before values gives us the greatest opportunity to drop values or annotate them with memoization or other features. Evaluation before copy resists introduction of rework without introducing need for memoization, and covers the common case. Final values are reduced because we assume the program as a whole might be copied for use in many locations.

This is really just a recommended default strategy. A runtime may adjust this at its own discretion, so long as it preserves semantics. Annotations will also affect evaluation strategy, for example `[A](eval)` could force evaluation of `A` before passing the value onwards. With annotations we could precisely defer computations, control linking, leverage parallelism, memoize results for incremental computing, stow large but infrequently referenced data to disk, fail-fast in case of obvious errors, enable visible optimizations, request JIT compilation. And so on. See also *Optimization*, below.

## Value Words

A 'value word' is any word whose evaluated definition is a single block. Natural numbers would be a common example, but we might also include booleans like `true` or `false`, or references such as `story_chapter32`. Lazy linking should ensure that value words are not linked before necessary. Thus, data plumbing can operate on value words directly:

        42 true w == true 42
        42 [] b   == [42]

Value words are convenient for preserving human-meaningful structure and support for hypermedia resources. 

*Aside:* Value words might be considered the 'nouns' of Awelon language, whereas most words are verbs. However, an analogy to natural language quickly breaks down. Awelon lacks an equivalent to adjectives, adverbs, or anaphora, at least without a lot of development work involving staged programming and *Editable Views*.

## Deferred Computations, Link Control, and Coinductive Data

The *arity annotations* `(a2)` to `(a9)` have simple rewrite rules:

        [B][A](a2) == [B][A]
        [C][B][A](a3) == [C][B][A]
        ...

To clarify, it is the *annotation* that has the given arity. Arity annotations specify nothing of their context.

Arity annotations serve a valuable role in controlling computation. For example, the program `[[A](a2)F]` has the same type and semantics as `[[A]F]`, but the former prevents evaluation of `F` from immediately observing `[A]`. Arity annotations can be used to guard against useless partial evaluations and control linking. For example, if we define swap as `w = (a2) [] b a` then we can avoid observing the useless intermediate structure `[A] w => [[A]] a`. An evaluator must wait for two arguments to `w` before linking.

Arity annotations serve a very useful role in modeling [thunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk) and [coinductive data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinduction). It is sometimes useful to model 'infinite' data structures to be computed as we observe them - procedurally generated streams or scene graphs.

## Fixpoints and Loops

Fixpoint is a function useful for modeling loop behaviors. For Awelon language, I favor the following variant of the [strict Z fixpoint combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Strict_fixed_point_combinator):

        [X][F]z == [X][[F]z]F 
        z = [[(a3) c i] b (eq_z) [c] a b w i](a3) c i

        Using Definitions:
               [A]i == A            (inline)         i = [] w a d
            [B][A]w == [A][B]       (swap)           w = (a2) [] b a

        Assuming Annotation:
            [(def of foo)](eq_foo) => [foo]
            and arity annotations

The arity annotation `(a3)` defers further expansion of the `[[F]z]` result. The `(eq_z)` annotation supports aesthetic presentation and preserves accelerated performance across serialization. Readers unfamiliar or uncomfortable with fixpoint may benefit from evaluating `[X][F]z` by hand a few times to grasp its behavior.

*Note:* Fixpoint is notoriously difficult for humans to grok and awkward to use by hand. Use of *Editable Views* and especially *named locals* can help, potentially hiding the fixpoint. Even better is to hide most loops behind various collections or stream processing abstractions.

## Memoization

The primary basis for incremental computing in Awelon is [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization). 

The essential idea is to record a computation and its result, and then to lookup the result rather than recompute it. In context of Awelon systems, word definitions and `$secureHash` references are natural targets for memoization because the computation has already been recorded and the overhead for lookup of the result is much smaller. But we can support flexible and precise access to runtime memoization through annotations:

        [computation](memo)

The main challenge for effective memoization is precise lookup. Irrelevant differences between very similar dictionaries should not interfere with this lookup. Ideally, even comments and basic data plumbing can be excluded. Hence, our lookup might operate on a partially optimized representation of the computation that potentially knows about types and arities. However, even imprecise implementations of memoization can be effective and useful. The sophistication of memoization is left to the runtime.

To support incremental computing, memoization must be combined with cache-friendly computing patterns and data structures. Persistent data structures leveraging stowage - finger trees, tries - are especially useful. For example, if we memoize a computed monoidal value for each node in a persistent tree, computing a slightly different tree could easily reuse most of the memoization effort.

## Static Linking

Consider a redirect, `foo = bar`. When we link `foo`, we'll always link `bar`. This is due to the lazy evaluation rule: we won't link `foo` unless doing so also results in rewrites other than a trivial inlining of foo's definition. Hence, we could skip the intermediate rewrite to word `bar` and simply rewrite to bar's definition. Transitively, we can say foo's static link definition is bar's static link definition.

This isn't limited to redirects. Similar analysis can be performed in context of arity annotations and type analysis. It is feasible to optimize static link definitions far beyond simple evaluation. Annotations could make static link optimizations explicit and visible in the program.

## Optimization

There are many semantically valid rewrites that Awelon's naive evaluator does not perform. For example:

        [A] a [B] a => [A B] a      apply composes
        [A] a d     => d A          tail call optimization
        [] a        =>              apply identity is a NOP
        b d         => d d          either way we drop two values
        c d         =>              drop the copy
        c [d] a     =>              drop the other copy
        [i] b       =>              because [A][i]b == [[A]i] == [A]
        b i         => i            expansion of [X][F]b i == [X][F]i
        [] b a      => w            by definition of w
        c w         => c            copies are equivalent
        [E] w d     => d [E]        why swap first?

A runtime has discretion to perform optimizations that are invisible in the evaluated result, e.g. for *Static Linking*. Visible optimizations are permitted only when guided by annotation. 

Pattern-matching rewrite optimizations tend in general to be fragile, affected by abstraction and order of evaluation. However, there are many robust optimization techniques with good results. For example, partial evaluation can be modeled by propagating variables through an evaluation then extracting the variables:

* variables `A B C` as undefined subprograms
* evaluate `[C][B][A]function` to completion
* rewrite to extract `A B C` free variables

A simple extraction algorithm:

        T(X,E) - extract X from E such that:
            T(X,E) does not contain X
            [X] T(X,E) == E

        T(X, E) | E does not contain X      => d E
        T(X, X)                             => i
        T(X, [X])                           => 
        T(X, [E])                           => [T(X,E)] b
        T(X, F G)
            | only F contains X             => T(X,F) G
            | only G contains X             => [F] a T(X,G)
            | otherwise                     => c [T(X,F)] a T(X,G)


This would, for example, tear through arity annotations and deeply eliminate unnecessary data plumbing, carrying partial data along for the ride. Of course, there might also be some advantage to rearranging data on the stack to minimize later data plumbing.

Another useful technique is, for known conditional types, we can partially evaluate results under both conditions, weighing exponential expansion of code versus potential benefits of specialized code. Anyhow, there are a lot of possible optimizations that can be represented by simple rewriting of Awelon code.

## Compilation

Direct interpretation of Awelon code can be reasonably efficient, using threaded interpreters. 

But to make it faster we can potentially rewrite code to an intermediate language that uses an auxiliary data/return stack, call-return operations, labels and jumps for tail-call optimized loops and so on. Even better, we can feasibly target a simple "register machine" model to eliminate data plumbing from the stack and avoid bindings on the heap if they're used statically, instead tracking a compile-time stack of logical register-objects.

Of course, when compiling a register machine, you might need to keep an extra code map back from the program pointer to the logical register objects so we can serialize code. But that isn't a new idea.

## Parallelism

A simple form of fork-join parallelism can be expressed as `[computation](par)`. The block could be moved around while computing in parallel, but upon observation (via apply) we'll need to wait on the result. This covers a lot of use cases, and it's also relatively easy to implement.

For more sophisticated forms of parallelism, we'll need *Acceleration*.

For example, to leverage SIMD, SSE, or GPGPU we'll probably need to accelerate a [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), or alternatively accelerate evaluation for a DSL that represents a safe subset of OpenCL. 

Similarly, to leverage cloud or mesh network computing with decentralized communications, we could accelerate evaluation for [Kahn process networks (KPNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks). A weakness of conventional KPNs is that they cannot merge asynchronous data from multiple channels. But it is possible to model temporal, reactive KPNs where 'time' or clock 'tick' messages are implicitly added to every channel. These could then be compiled into conventional KPNs.

Accelerators aren't trivial, but a couple accelerators could cover the vast majority of parallel evaluation for a wide variety of problems and domains. 

*Aside:* KPNs are also an interesting alternative to monadic effects for modeling purely functional applications.

## Structural Scope

Blocks naturally delimit the input scope for a computation. For example, we know that in `[B][[A]foo]`, `foo` can access `[A]` but not `[B]`. And we can trivially leverage this with the bind operation `b`. But Awelon also supports multiple outputs, and so scoping output is a relevant concern. To address this, one feasible option is to introduce *tuple assertions* to annotate output arity.

        [](t0) == []
        [[A]](t1) == [[A]]
        [[B][A]](t2) == [[B][A]]
        ...

Tuple assertions could be deleted early if they are validated statically. Otherwise, some lightweight dynamic reflection could be used. Similar to arity annotations, tuples larger than `(t5)` should be rare in practice.

In addition to controlling output counts, programmers may wish to fail fast based on declared structure. To support this, Awelon supports a structure annotation `(seal_key)` and paired structure assertion `(open_key)` with the following rewrite semantics:

        (seal_foo) (open_foo) ==

Otherwise, they won't rewrite at all, and prevent further computation. This could be combined with a simple codebase analysis constraint, that these annotations only be used directly from words with a matching prefix `foo`, to provide a simple basis for modular abstract data types.

## Substructural Scope

[Substructural types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_type_system) allow us to reason about whether a value is used, or limit how many times a value is used. This can be convenient for modeling finite resources, intermediate states in a protocol, or ensuring certain steps are performed by a client computation. Awelon lacks primitive support for substructural types, but annotations can be leveraged:

* `(nc)` - mark a value non-copyable, aka 'affine'
* `(nd)` - mark a value non-droppable, aka 'relevant'
* inherit substructure of bound values (op `b`).

        [A](nc) [B] b == [[A](nc) B](nc)

Substructural attributes do not prevent application of a value with `a`. Copy and drop are explicit in Awelon, so dynamically enforcing these attributes is feasible, a lot easier than it would be in a variable substitution based language. But ideally, they would be enforced statically. 

*Note:* Whether Awelon systems implement substructural types is entirely optional. And it might be more efficiently represented at the type description layer, in which case these annotations would be more to support type inference.

## Error Annotations

An `(error)` annotation marks a value erroneous and non-applicable. We cannot observe an error value with operator `a`. Attempting to observe the error value would prevent further rewrites.

        [B][E](error)a == [][E](error)a d [B]

An erroneous value can still be bound, copied, dropped like normal. It only causes problems when we try to observe it. 

## Garbage Data

In some cases, it might be convenient to erase data that we know we shouldn't use in the future to recover memory resources, yet leave a placeholder and preserve other annotations (such as `(nd)` for relevant data). We could represent this pattern by use of a `(trash)` annotation:

        [A](trash)      => [](error)
        [A](nd)(trash)  => [](nd)(error)

We drop data but preserve substructure. Because the data has been lost, the resulting value is marked erroneous. Memory required for `A` may then be recycled. This is essentially a form of manual memory management.

## Active Debugging

Awelon's program rewrite semantics make it relatively easy to observe a computation in progress. Data is visible in the program representation, rather than hidden behind variables that must be queried via debugger. And of course, more conventional debugging applies. Some things we can easily do:

* set breakpoints for linking of specific words
* animate evaluation via frame capture on breakpoints
* evaluate in small steps more generally
* `(trace)` annotation for console/log style debugging
* log inputs to specific words (specified arity)

Debugging should be configurable through the runtime's interpeter or compiler.

## Static Typing

Awelon can be evaluated without static typing. There is no type driven dispatch or overloading. But if we can detect errors early by static analysis, that is a good thing. Further, static types are also useful for verifiable documentation, interactive editing (recommending relevant words based on type context), and performance of JIT compiled code. Strong static type analysis makes a *very* nice default.

We might represent our primitive types as:

        a   : S [B] [S â†’ S'] â†’ S' [B]
        b   : S [B] [E B â†’ E'] â†’ S [E â†’ E']
        c   : S [A] â†’ S [A] [A]
        d   : S [A] â†’ S
        [F] : S â†’ S [type(F)]

The type sequence `S C B A` aligns with a program structure `S[C][B][A]`. Effectively, `S` is the remainder of our program 'stack' when we view the program as rewriting a stack-like structure. In context of Awelon, we know that value types `C B A` must be first class functions, which potentially encode data.

Value sealers like `(seal_foo)` would require special non-block types.

        (seal_foo) : S -> S <foo>
        (open_foo) : S <foo> -> S

Annotations can augment static type analysis in many ways, providing extra structure and assertions against which we can validate inference. Structural and substructural annotations would ideally be validated statically and have no dynamic behavior. A remaining concern is static typing of conditional behavior. We might represent various conditional data types:

        (bool)      S [S     â†’ S'] [S     â†’ S'] â†’ S'
        (opt)       S [S     â†’ S'] [S [A] â†’ S'] â†’ S'
        (sum)       S [S [B] â†’ S'] [S [A] â†’ S'] â†’ S'
        (cond)      S [A     â†’ S'] [B     â†’ S'] â†’ S'

Knowing these types, we can also check for consistency between conditional branches. Unfortunately, inferring these types is difficult. Annotations can provide a much needed hint. I imagine programmers will want annotations for many common types - naturals, texts, binaries, lists, labels, records, and so on. Anything we accelerate or use frequently enough for a runtime to recognize.

### Deferred Typing

Simple static types are oft inexpressive, constraining more than helping.

We can introduce an explicit escape. Consider a `(dyn)` annotation used as `[F] b b (dyn)` with formal behavior `[A](dyn) => [A]`. The presence of `(dyn)` does not suppress obvious static type errors, but may suppress warnings or errors that result from being *unable* to infer static types for a given subprogram, types too sophisticated for our simple type checker. Dependent types are an example where types are likely too sophisticated for a simple checker. Conveniently, the ability to eliminate `(dyn)` via partial evaluations at compile time would enable us to leverage dynamically typed macro-like behaviors while still supporting a statically typed system. 

### Sophisticated Types

I propose a convention of defining `foo_type` to declare a type metadata for `foo`. This enables flexible abstraction and composition of type descriptions, expression of sophisticated types (contracts, Hoare logic, etc.), and provision of auxiliary hints or proofs. If we want to properly support dependent, existential, higher order, GADT, etc. types, we'll probably need to do so at this layer. By also providing the type check algorithms via the same dictionary, we might also simplify portable consistency checks.

Related to static typing, non-terminating evaluation in Awelon is always an error. There is no utility in unbounded divergence for a pure computation, though we might use arity annotations to defer computations and represent coinductive structure. In any case, static type analysis should attempt a limited termination analysis. While solving the halting problem isn't possible in general, obvious errors can always be reported.

## Editable Views

Awelon is designed to use a simple technique to support richer programming styles, DSLs, and larger programs: Awelon shifts the rich syntax burden to [projectional editing](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ProjectionalEditing.html) in the form of *editable views*. 

*Aside:* By *editable views* I mean to emphasize purely functional, bidirectional rewrites between serializable representations. Similar to functional lenses. Projectional editing encompasses editable views and a lot more.

My initial emphasis is textual views, such that we can readily integrate favored editors and perhaps even leverage [Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) to operate on a dictionary through a conventional filesystem. Numbers are a useful example for textual editable views. A viable sketch:

        #42         == (Awelon's 42)
        42          == [#42 #0 integer]
        -7          == [#0 #7 integer]
        3.141       == [3141 -3 decimal]
        -0.0070     == [-70 -4 decimal]
        2.998e8     == [2998 5 decimal]
        -4/6        == [-4 #6 rational]

Awelon's natural numbers here are given the `#` prefix in favor of a more aesthetic representation for signed numbers. From there, we build a tower of numbers. The basic approach of building views upon views is convenient because it makes views more extensible. For example, if we have no support for rational numbers, we'd still see `[-4 #6 rational]` which is still sensible to a human reader. Support for rational numbers or hexadecimal or similar can be added if missing.

Beyond numbers, we can develop editable views that are convenient for continuation-passing style, generators, or monadic computation. Editable views can feasibly support records and labeled data. Support for tables and graphs are feasible. Conveniently, it isn't difficult to experiment with editable views, tuning them to a user or project or developing them over time, because the views aren't the primary representation for Awelon code.

Most editable views should have an escape for code that they isn't recognized. For example, the `#42` escape for natural numbers might be generalized as an escape for words `#foo` or even full blocks `#[raw awelon code]`. This ensures universal access to Awelon behavior and the dictionaries. Of course, some DSL-inspired views might cleverly constrain subprograms to a subset of Awelon to better support acceleration.

Ideally, most editable views should be computable, in the sense of having a normal form that can be the result of a normal evaluation process. Computable views enable the *evaluated result* of the program to have the *same view* as our programs. Or perhaps another, more suitable view. When we add 3.141 and -0.007, we want to see 3.134 in the program output. Hence, `[3134 -3 decimal]` should be a normal form, perhaps via arity annotations in `decimal`.

Design of computable views is very sensitive to arity annotations and accelerators. A consequence is that editable views should be *defined* within the same dictionary they're used to view by some simple convention. Perhaps a word defining a `[[viewâ†’code][codeâ†’view]]` pair where `code` and `view` are represented as text. Representing views within the dictionary is convenient for testing and caching of views, and for updating views based on application or edit session state (e.g. so we can separate namespace from code). 

With computable views in mind, we might represent comments as:

        // comment  ==  "comment"(a2)d

The arity annotation ensures the comment is not deleted until it might prevent progress from the left side, and hence we can always inject comments into values. A relevant point is that we aren't limited to one 'type' of comment, and comments of other types can easily inject flexible rendering hints into Awelon code. The discussion on *Named Local Variables* offers one very useful example, or a comment might include trace output for active debugging.

Editable views essentially form a compiler/decompiler that treats Awelon language as a functional macro-assembly. The main difference from conventional languages above a bytecode is that the Awelon code is treated as the canonical source, and we're forced to 'decompile' said code into our language of editing. The indirection provided by the decompiler simplifies issues like whitespace formatting and forwards/backwards compatibility.

With editable views, individual definitions can scale many orders of magnitude. It is even possible to represent conventional 'modules' in terms of expressions that construct first-class records of functions, though I'd encourage one word per independently useful function as the normal case.

Although initial emphasis is textual views, it is feasible to model richly interactive graphical views involving tables, graphs, canvases, checkboxes, sliders, drop-down menus, and so on. A sophisticated projectional editor could support frames or a zoomable interface where a word's definition may be logically inlined into the current view. 

*Aside:* The vast majority of punctuation characters were reserved for use with editable views. It's a lot easier to develop sophisticated editable views when we don't need to worry about ambiguity with Awelon words. 

### Named Local Variables

An intriguing opportunity for editable views is support for local variables, like lambdas and let expressions. This would ameliorate use cases where point-free programming is pointlessly onerous, such as working with fixpoints or algebraic math expressions. It also supports a more conventional programming style where desired. Consider a let or lambda syntax of form:

        \ X Y Z -> CODE ==  "\X Y Z"(a2)d CODE'

This plucks three items off the stack, giving them local names within `CODE`. On the right hand side, the special comment - `"\X Y Z"(a2)d` - enables the view to later recover the variable names for future edits. We can compute `CODE' = T(Z, T(Y, T(X, CODE)))` using a simple algorithm:

        T(X, E) | E does not contain X      => d E
        T(X, X)                             => 
        T(X, [onF][onT] if)                 => [T(X, onF)][T(X, onT)] if
        T(X, [E])                           => [T(X,E)] b
        T(X, F G)
            | only F contains X             => T(X,F) G
            | only G contains X             => [F] a T(X,G)
            | otherwise                     => c [T(X,F)] a T(X,G)

This algorithm is adapted from the partial evaluation optimization leveraging free variables. The main difference from the optimization is that we know our variables are value words and we may desire special handling for conditional behaviors like `if` to avoid copying data into each branch. 

Lambdas can be leveraged into let expressions (like `let var = expr in CODE` or `CODE where var = expr`) or the Haskell `do` notation. Local recursion is possible if a view automatically introduces a fixpoint. Further, with variables we can feasibly introduce infix expressions like `((X + Y) * X)`, though our view may need to embed assumptions about arity and preferred associativity of the chosen operators.

### Qualified Namespaces

Awelon's hierarchical dictionaries support a simple form of namespacing. But it falls to editable views to support local shorthand, e.g. some form of `using large_prefix as x` or `using package_of_nicknames`. If we assume editable views are maintained within the dictionary, it is feasible to use comments to help control the view, tweaking the language as needed. An intriguing possibility is to integrate a database of nicknames for secure hash resources into the view, where said database is represented within the dictionary.

### Labeled Data - Records and Variants 

Labeled sum types (variants) allow conditional discrimination on a label. Labeled product types (records) allow us to access to heterogeneous data by a label. Primitive sum `(A + B)` and product `(A * B)` types are simple and sufficient for many use cases. But labeled data is self-documenting (label informs human) and extensible (add more labels).

A useful way to encode labeled sums is by deep primitive sum structures. That is, we use a `[[[value] l] r] l]` structure where the left-right-left path is extended to multiple bytes encoding a human-meaningful label. Unlike label-value pairs, deep sums do not require dependent types. 

A labeled product can similarly be modeled as a bit-trie, modeled using pairs such that in `[[A] [B]]` the left-path is `[A]` and the right-path is `[B]`. We simply need to arrange our trie along the same left-right-left paths as our labels. Again, no dependent types are required. Empty paths could be filled with a unit value. A reflective variant could be based on use of sum types rather than pairs.

A useful label encoding is `(RL|RR)*LL`, where `RL` corresponds to constructor `[l] b [r] b`. The `(RL|RR)*` structure then represents a finite `(0|1)*` bitfield, within which we encode texts or numbers. The final `LL` terminates the label. This encoding has the nice properties of being a self-synchronizing code. Naive construction of the trie supports enumeration of labels and merging. The unused `LR` slot can potentially be used in the record as a name shadowing list. 

Unfortunately, the trie is awkward and inefficient to work with directly. A better alternative is instead to work with a trie *constructor* - a function that, given an initial record object, loads it with data. In Awelon text, this might look something like `[[A] "foo" tc [B] "bar" tc ...]`. Relevantly, the ordering of labels in this representation is not relevant, composition of record functions would essentially represent update of a record, and the encoding is not sparse. I'm assuming the type of trie-cons `tc` is dependent on the text argument. OTOH, we could use an expanded label structure if necessary. An editable view could feasibly reduce to a more aesthetic `[[A]:foo [B]:bar ...]` (ordered to taste). 

Acceleration of records would logically construct a trie and extract an updated new record function with every operation but really just using an optimized representation like a hashmap under the hood. Acceleration of functions related to labeled variants could serve a similar role of improving performance and aesthetics.

Assuming aesthetic, accelerated, labeled data, Awelon can support parameter objects, extensible event types, labeled case expressions, and a more conventional programming style with events and routing on human labels. 
 
## Unique References and In-Place Updates

Persistent structures are great and should be used frequently. But in-place update has some performance advantages that are reasonably difficult to give up. 

Fortunately, purely functional languages can support in-place update whenever we have a unique reference. We can model copy-on-write shared arrays, where subsequent writes are applied to the unique array without further copying. Lambda calculus makes this feature difficult to achieve (because the lexical environment is implicitly 'shared'). But Awelon makes copying explicit with operator `c`, so it's very easy to dynamically track uniqueness of a reference.

Arrays and records are the most useful targets for this treatment.

We can represent a list as an array (guided by `(array)` annotations). We can accelerate functions to access and update lists at indexed offsets. When the update function is applied to a unique array, it can update it in place. If applied to a shared array, it must copy the array first to get a unique array, but then all subsequent updates are in-place until the array is shared by logical copying via operator `c`. Records would receive similar treatment, albeit using a hashmap in place of the array.

*Note:* The `(nc)` annotation restricts copying of the marked value. Use of this can help enforce preservation of uniqueness, or at least help fail-fast debug cases where we want to restrict copying.

## Hierarchical Dictionaries and Namespaces

Awelon reserves the `@` character to support hierarchical structure. 

Words of form `foo@dict` refers to the definition of `foo` in context of `@dict`. Similarly, `42@d` is `[41 succ]@d` is `[41@d succ@d]`, and `"hello"@d` is `[104 "ello" cons]@d`, and `$secureHash@d` will interpret the secure hash definition in context of `d`. Even some annotations may be usefully qualified, e.g. `(eq_z)@d` would reference the definition of `z@d`. These namespace qualifiers are second-class. No space is permitted between a word or block and the `@dict` qualifier. Logically, `foo@d` can be understood as just another word.

The dictionary name must also be a valid word, syntactically. How dictionary `@d` is defined is left to the dictionary representation, which Awelon language doesn't specify, but ideally should support lightweight dictionary structure sharing and efficient update.

Importantly, hierarchical dictionaries only permit the parent to reference child. There is no means for child to reference parent, no `..` path. Consequently, hierarchical dictionaries can be validated and evaluated and shared without context. This structural constraint is valuable for many [application model](ApplicationModel.md) patterns that involve messaging or publish-subscribe of full dictionaries, or use of dictionaries as documents or databases or other objects.

By Law of Demeter, programmers should avoid multi-level qualifiers like `foo@xy@zzy`, and it would be sensible to raise a warning when observed. However, such constructs may appear in the course of evaluation, and are read right to left, i.e. we look for meaning of `foo@xy` within dictionary `@zzy`.

### Localization

As a special optimization for hierarchical dictionaries, we may eliminate qualifiers that don't contribute to the program's behavior. For example, if natural numbers mean the same thing to the parent as they do to the child (based on underlying definitions of `zero` and `succ`), then `42@child` may be rewritten to just `42`.

## Staged and Generic Programming

Staged programming is a form of constant propagation. Awelon does not support this explicitly, but can model it. However, for staging to work in practice usually requires some syntactic support to clearly distinguish which computations are in which stage, and ensure uniform propagation of the staged constants. I am interested in use of editable views to extend Awelon with staging.

I'm especially interested in staging for generic programming - e.g. working with functions overloaded on data types or traits. In this case, our earlier stage would propagate information about the future program context, the types that will be on the stack. Multiple stage passes may be required, depending on how sophisticated the static type inference algorithms. A suitable *Editable View* can act as an extension to Awelon to make this feasible, and dictionaries can be developed that almost uniformly use generic programming.
