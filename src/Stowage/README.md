# Stowage

This package provides an LMDB-backed implementation for the abstract `Stowage` and `DB` types from the `Stowage.Data` package. This enables representations of durable and larger-than-memory data types with garbage collection, and also for transactional named variables. This is the first and primary backend for Stowage, though we might eventually pursue cloud-based implementations.
