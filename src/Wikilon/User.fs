// Wikilon's "User model".
//
// My current idea is to model our set of users as an Awelon dictionary,
// where each user may hierarchically be modeled as having an inventory,
// clipboard, equipment, and similar. Authorities can be modeled via an
// equipped hat/badge/role, keyring, or similar.
//
// But it seems I should probably delay authentication issues until we
// have something working. This is low priority.
